# Contributing to OpenOuroboros

## Some ground rules and expectations.
_Our ground rules and expectations are adapted from [opensource.guide](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)._

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution.
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How do I make a contribution?

### Getting started

1. Find an issue you are interested in addressing, or brainstorm a feature you would like to add.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
4. Create a new branch for your fix or feature using `git checkout -b feature/branch-name-here`.
5. Commit all your changes, pushing them to the remote repository using `git push origin feature/branch-name-here`.
6. Once you're ready for a code review, open a Pull Request.

### Pull request

Be sure the title of your pull request reflects the issue or feature you worked on, and include a detailed description of the changes made.

If you address an issue, please include the issue number associated with your change. 

Feel free to include any questions you have for the maintainer--we are happy to work with you!

### Celebrate

Once your pull request is merged, celebrate your success!

## Some styling requirements.

### Code

We enforce our coding style using [Black](https://github.com/python/black).

### Content
_Our guide for written content is borrowed from [opensource.guide](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide/blob/master/docs/styleguide.md)._

All written content should follow these principles:

* *Approachability*: Don't assume reader has prior knowledge
* *Brevity*: Keep it simple, link to outside content for deeper dives
* *Curation*: Amplify community best practices vs. any individual's point of view

Content should maintain a light-hearted, but wise (think classy, not overly excited) tone. Open source is fun! Readers should feel inspired, not discouraged, by the tone of your writing, and they should trust you to help them get started.
